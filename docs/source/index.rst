PyLops-GPU
==========

.. note:: This library is under early development.

   Expect things to constantly change until version v1.0.0.

This library is an extension of `PyLops <https://pylops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
to run operators on GPUs.

As much as `numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_ and
`scipy <http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html>`_ lie at the core of the parent project
PyLops, PyLops-GPU heavily builds on top of
`PyTorch <http://pytorch.org>`_ and takes advantage of the same optimized
tensor computations used in PyTorch for deep learning using GPUs and CPUs.

Doing so, linear operators can be computed on GPUs.

Here is a simple example showing how a diagonal operator can be created,
applied and inverted using PyLops:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np
   from pylops import Diagonal

   n = int(1e6)
   x = np.ones(n)
   d = np.arange(n) + 1.

   Dop = Diagonal(d)

   # y = Dx
   y = Dop*x

and similarly using PyLops-GPU:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np
   import torch
   from pylops_gpu.utils.backend import device
   from pylops_gpu import Diagonal

   dev = device() # will return 'gpu' if GPU is available

   n = int(1e6)
   x = torch.ones(n, dtype=torch.float64).to(dev)
   d = (torch.arange(0, n, dtype=torch.float64) + 1.).to(dev)

   Dop = Diagonal(d, device=dev)

   # y = Dx
   y = Dop*x

Running these two snippets of code in Google Colab with GPU enabled gives a 50+
speed up for the forward pass.

History
-------
PyLops-GPU was initially written and it is currently maintained by `Equinor <https://www.equinor.com>`_
It is an extension of `PyLops <https://pylops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for large-scale optimization with
*GPU*-powered linear operators that can be tailored to our needs, and as contribution to the free software community.
